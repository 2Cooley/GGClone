Story:
	There is a super evil bad guy who plans on destroying the world. The UN has already tried to send many soldiers to stop this evil man, but none have succeeded. Your mission is to infiltrate his base, rescue your captured comrades, destroy his weapons, and stop him and his evil minions before it's too late.
	
Premise:
	A lone Delta Force soldier is dropped into the outskirts of the base. He must make his way through each section of the base, picking up team-mates as he goes, with the end goal being destroying the evil bad guy's weapons and then capturing/killing him.
	
Gameplay:
	-Each section of the base will be divided into its own level. The player must either kill every enemy in the level, or bring all team-mates to the exit of the level in order to progress to the next level. 
	-Once a character exits the level, he cannot be used again until the next level
	-Players eliminate enemies by using whatever guns and abilities their current character has
	-Each character has unique weapons and abilities that facilitate a diversity of play styles
	-Once an enemy sees a player character, he will call for reinforcements, imposing a time limit on the player. If the time limit runs out before the player beats the level, he will lose all soldiers who did not make it to the exit
	-Enemies who are shot and don't die, or who see a dead team-mate will be considered to have seen the player if not killed within a very short amount of time
	-Unless otherwise noted, enemies will only detect character within their field of view
	-A player does not have to rescue all team-mates in a level to progress to the next level. However, if a player kills all enemies before rescuing all team-mates, he can decide whether or not he wants to go back and rescue his team-mates before progressing. If he chooses to rescue remaining team-mates, time will continue to count down, and reinforcements will arrive (capturing all remaining team-mates) if time runs out. During this period, the player can decide to leave the level at any time, taking with him all remaining team-mates who are not on the field of play.
	-The player must avoid damage. If he takes a certain amount of damage (most likely 1-2 hits) his character will be injured, and he will have to be rescued by a different character in order to avoid (re)capture.
	-On most levels, the player will encounter captured soldiers who he can rescue by escorting them to the exit. Once a captured soldier reaches an exit, he will be available for use in the next level.
	-Captured soldiers will be invulnerable while being escorted. They can however be spotted by enemies, causing reinforcements to be called.
	-If a character is escorting a captive and becomes injured, the captive soldier being escorted will become re-captured/ disappear, and the soldier who was just injured will take his place. In other words, you must avoid being injured while escorting a soldier, or risk losing him until a later level. In this way, it is possible to lose most/all of one's soldiers in any given level.
	-Team-mates who have been (re)captured during play will be available for rescue in later levels.
